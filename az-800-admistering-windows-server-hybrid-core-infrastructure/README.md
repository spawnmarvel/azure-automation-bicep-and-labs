## Tips

Helpful Tips for AZ-800:

* The "Hybrid" Rule: This exam is obsessed with Azure Arc and Azure File Sync. If the answer involves connecting a local server to the cloud, look for these first.
* Identity is King: Nearly 35% of the exam is Active Directory. If you aren't familiar with FSMO roles or Group Policy inheritance, prioritize those modules.
* PowerShell is mandatory: Unlike AZ-104 where you can mostly use the portal, AZ-800 will test you on specific Windows Server PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., Install-ADDSDomainController vs. Add-WindowsFeature).
